# Projec Micro-Benchmark

## Note:
- This micro-benchmark was done using `std::time` rust timing module.
- Each record is an average of at least 10 iteration for better accuracy, except `list --sort --tag` which was done in 24 iteration. The 24 iteration consist of 4 tag filter category, each of these filter category iterates 3 times on a particulat --sort variant.
- The benchmark was done using two sample data of different sizes, one containing two thousand contacts denoted on the table as "2k", and the other containing five thousand contacts, denoted on the table as "5k".
- Contacts in sample data are randomized and unsorted, except it is a benchmark requirement denoted by (sorted).
